  <h1>SKULL FOOD™</h1>
 <p>Rebellious. Clean-label. Flavor-forward. Coming soon to your taste buds.</p>
  <div class="story">
    <p>SKULL FOOD™ was born from the combined expertise of a chemist and a chef entrepreneur with over 15 years in international cuisine and packaged food. Together, they didn’t just create healthy products — they made them wild, unique, and bold.</p>
    <p>Every product is made from 100% real ingredients. No gums. No preservatives. No added oils or any ingredient to fake weight. Just pure culinary fusion — flavor-forward, and unapologetically rebellious.</p>
    <p>SKULL FOOD™ isn’t just a flavor print. It’s a rebellion. A non-ordinary brand. We stand for transparency, taste, and you know… not classic.</p>
    <p><strong>Join the rebellion.</strong></p>
